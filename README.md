# FA23-3D-Spatial-Data-Visualizations

## Our Proposal Document

### Introduction
Our project will consider the benefit to spatial data analysis when data can be visualized in three dimensions. Specifically, we are interested in the degree to which adding a third dimension to spatial data analysis improves the quality and ease of analytic tasks. This research matters because spatial data analysis impacts communities (census surveys), ecosystems (climate modeling), and infrastructure (public policy). These three areas of research affect the lives of people living all around the world. In an ever-growing data space we need improved ways to effectively analyze data. We address the quality aspect by measuring accuracy of analysis and we address ease of analysis by measuring time it takes to perform the analysis. We believe that adding a third dimension to spatial data visualization may enrich the visual analytic experience by allowing users to visualize two spatially related features simultaneously. For our project we will aggregate data across US census counties. The features we will focus on will be average (mean) data measurement and data availability (frequency of data collection). These two features are related because data availability informs confidence in the averages being visualized. These two features must often be considered in tandem when performing spatial data analysis across significant temporal ranges.

### Previous Works
	Ramachandran & Varoquaux[1]  describe a package for 3D scientific data visualization. Their framework, called Mayavi, exists to enrich data visualization along a third dimension. The authors discuss the libraries upon which their tool depends, the visualization features it offers, and the methodology used to build Mayavi. This project has been ongoing for several years and is very built out. It is designed to stand alone as a 3D visualization engine for data scientists.

Isenberg et al[2] present a research agenda for visualizing data in three dimensions using interactive tabletops and surfaces (ITSs). The authors cite two reasons for exploring data visualization in three dimensions: accessibility of the feature space and attainability of insight formation. The authors discuss several existing methods of using ITSs to visualize data in three dimensions, the benefits and drawbacks of each, as well as common design challenges in this field.

### Our Project
	We will build a 2D user interface and a 3D user interface that visualize the same data. We will include 20 participants in our study: 10 who have previous experience with spatial data analytics and 10 who do not. We will use these participants in a repeated measure study where each participant will complete an activity with the 2D and 3D visualizations. Each participant will be timed on how long it takes them to perform an analytics task. We will then measure the accuracy of their analysis, and survey them about their experience with both interfaces. The analytic task for each interface will be the same: describe the spatial trend in the data. We will tell participants about the importance of data availability in the context of the visual analysis, and we will tell them what the colors, tooltips, and elevations on the map mean. The 2D interface will display average values per county using a choropleth map. Hovering the mouse over a county will display the data availability in a tooltip. The 3D interface will display average values per county as an elevation: the county will be visually extruded from the map (using the 3rd dimension available). The counties will be colored based on data availability, allowing users to see average value and data availability at the same time.
	The research presented in [1] is similar to our project in that our exigency aligns with theirs; we are both working to facilitate 3D spatial data analysis. Our projects differ in that Ramachandran & Varoquaux have built a package to create 3D data visualization tools where we are interested in analyzing the extent to which adding the 3rd dimension to spatial data analysis improves the quality and ease of the analysis. We are interested in their research because we are looking for good packages and frameworks with which to build our experiments. Our research is similar to [2] in that we share their two reasons for exploring 3D data visualization. Our research differs in that our experiments are designed to assess a specific aspect of 3DUI. We hope to gain insights into existing methods for 3D data visualization, common issues that researchers run into, and existing research techniques for this field

We will employ two technologies for our project. We will use a React App with a DeckGL map to build the 2D user interface, and we will use the Meta Quest 2 VR headset to visualize our 3D user interface. We are still researching the best way to build the 3D user interface which we will visualize using the VR headset.

### Quantitative/Qualitative Design
	We will be collecting data relating to 1) time it takes a user to complete a data analysis task, 2) accuracy of their analysis, and 3) user survey results. We will develop a rubric for grading the accuracy of the user’s analysis to ensure we have an adequate measure. We will develop 3 survey questions targeted at understanding the user’s experience of each interface. The questions will ask users to grade each interface on a scale from 1 - 5. By the end of our experimentation we should have a time (in seconds), an accuracy grade (1 - 5), and survey results (3 questions x 2 interfaces = 6 results, graded 1 - 5). We will put these results in a table and chart. We use these tables and charts to analyze the difference in user experience and task completion. From this we can determine if there is a statistical difference on the results using a 2D and 3D interface by using the averages and standard deviations we collect. From our data we hope to learn to what extent adding a 3rd dimension to spatial data analysis improves the quality and ease of the analysis.

### Conclusion
Our project will analyze the extent to which adding a third dimension to spatial data analysis improves the quality and ease of the analysis. We will do this through a repeated measure study with 20 participants who will help determine the benefits of a 3D interface. We validate our research in the context of two user interfaces visualizing the same data: a 2D and a 3D interface. The analytic task for each interface will be the same. We will analyze the data collected to perform analyses on the benefits of a 3D environment regarding spatial analysis.
