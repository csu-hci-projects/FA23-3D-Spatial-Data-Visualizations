# 3D Spatial Data Visualizations
### Teammembers: Alizee Barney, Kassidy Barram, Matthew Young. 

## Description of Applications 
For our project, we created a 2D spatial visualziation webpage as well as a 3D version that is viewed in a Meta Quest 2 headset. Our 2D webpage shows a 3 x 4 square grid, this grid is a simplified representation of a spatial area, where each square represents a spatial region(state, county, etc.). Each square is colored to represent a relative temperature. The darker blue, the colder, and the redder the warmer. In our 2D webpage, there is the functionality of hovering over a square to observe the number of data observations have been taken for that region. We developed the 3D application with Unity. This project was the same as the 2D (3 x 4 grid, red - blue coloring for temperature), however, in the 3D application we created extrusion to represent the number of observations for a region.
